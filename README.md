## Introduction

This web page is a fully styled and responsive landing page for the South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office. It was built to demonstrate my ability to turn a design artifact into a responsive and accessible html document.

## Highlights

- HTML document created using React and TypeScript on a scaffhold generated by create-react-app
- Styled with Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first CSS paradigm implemented with media queries, Flexbox, and Grid
- Renders drop down animations with react-transition-group
- Uses fonts (Open Sans, Roboto Condensed, and Roboto Slab) from the Google Fonts API
- Uses icon SVGs from iconmonstr
- Uses a file structure that separates the main sections of the page
- Unit testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- Passes Accessibility test on Google Lighthouse with 98%

## Features

- Search bar and expanded menu in the navigation bar
- Search bar in hero section of the page
- Four cards that act as links to different important parts of the website
- List of popular links
- List of recent updates and links to the articles
- List of calendar of events with location and contact info
- Button that smoothly scrolls the top of the page into view
- Footer with links and addresses

## Prerequisites

This project was built on a Windows OS with the following tools installed:

- git version 2.31.1.windows.1
- yarn v1.22.10
- NodeJS v16.13.1

## Scripts

First, `cd` into the `pww-exercise` directory.

- `yarn install` will install this project's dependencies
- `yarn build` will create a production build of this project
- `serve -s build` will serve the production build on port 5000
- `yarn start` will start a development server for this project
- `yarn test` will run tests with Jest

NOTE: `npm` can be used instead of `yarn`, and the `serve cli` may need to be installed before using the `serve` command.

## Challenges

This was my first time using Tailwind CSS and it took a little while to get used to; however, I think this will be my go-to CSS framework for now on. It cuts down on the number of files I'm working with, and it's nice to have css and JSX code all in the same place.

Building the web page from the style guide was challenging when it came to implementing responsive design. Some styles were not maintainable at smaller screen sizes. For example, the South Carolina RFA logo does not fit well in the header on mobile screen sizes, and the same goes for the lengthy title and slogan. I decided to address this issue by removing the logo and shortening the heading text for mobile screen widths. I also chose to only display the additional links (which are also available in the menu drop down) for larger screen sizes. I thought the navigation search bar was important so I kept it for all screen sizes. The rest of the page was relatively straightforward to design responsive layouts for, though I did need to take some creative liberties with the calendar section.

Some other minor challenges were:

- Aligning the main navigation search bar properly
- Matching colors with design artifact
- Deciding what size (height) to display the hero background image at

## Alternatives

There are many libraries to construct a web page with, but I chose to use React due to my confortability with the library. I could have also used a different CSS setup (plain CSS, CSS modules, or styled-components), but I chose to use Tailwind CSS because I wanted to learn the framework and I liked how it reduced the file size and number of files. Finally, I could have created the icons using CSS, but it was more convenient to download SVGs, but this does slightly increase the size of the assets folder loaded by the browser.
